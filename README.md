And with the Pomodoro timer for Apple Watch, you can use the Pomodoro technique on your Apple Watch to stay focused and on track, no matter where you are.

The Pomodoro technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s as a way to help him stay focused and productive while studying at university. The basic idea behind the Pomodoro technique is to break down your work into 25-minute intervals, separated by short breaks. During each 25-minute interval, or "Pomodoro," you focus on a specific task without any distractions or interruptions. After each Pomodoro, you take a short break to rest and recharge. This helps to prevent burnout and maintain your focus and productivity over the long term.
